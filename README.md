# hovercraft-competition

This code was developed for the Hovercraft Competition at Concordia University, in collaboration with my team. The hovercraft successfully navigated the competition trail, overcoming all obstacles through efficient stabilization and obstacle avoidance mechanisms.

It features:
	•	Real-Time Stabilization: Maintains balance using an MPU6050 IMU.
	•	Obstacle Detection and Avoidance: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles effectively.
	•	Dynamic Maneuverability: Adjusts fan and servo motor controls for smooth and precise turns.
